- aboutme: Hello <span class="wave" title="Namaste!">ðŸ‘‹</span>! I'm Prashant, a software engineer based in Boston, MA. I enjoy solving complex problems using code and building things that live on the internet. I'm always searching for the next challenge; no task is too scary nor too difficult. <br>When I'm not coding, you'll find me cooking, exercising, fidging with a Rubik's cube <img class="rubik-img" src="../assets/svg/rubik.svg" alt="rubix" title="Rubik's Cube"> or surfing the web for memes and dad jokes.
